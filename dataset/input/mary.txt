In 'What is Matter?', we learn the definition of matter, its properties, and how matter relates to energy. 
Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space (volume). 
We can detect matter because it does have mass and take up space. 
Common examples are solids like a bed and a bug, liquids like water and milk, and gas like air and smoke. 
Scientists classify matter based on its physical and chemical properties.
A physical property is something we can observe without changing the essential, atomic identity of the matter. 
For example, its shape, size, malleability, and density are all properties we can observe without fundamentally changing the matter. 
However, a chemical property requires the observer to change the essential, atomic identity of the matter. 
For example, a chemical property of paper is flammability. 
When paper burns, the paper's atomic make-up is changed and it is no longer paper. 
A final property of matter is energy. 
Although you cannot see or touch energy, all matter has it. 
Energy is transferred between matter.
