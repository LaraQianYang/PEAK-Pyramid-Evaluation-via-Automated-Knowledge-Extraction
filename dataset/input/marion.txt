The passage, What is Matter, mainly focused on the topic of matter and its components. 
Matter is identified as being present everywhere and in all substances. 
What is unique is that individuals are able to observe certain forms of matter using their senses while other forms are not so easily observed. 
The latter requires the assistance of a specific instrument such as a microscope. 
The passage further explained that matter can be broken down into physical properties and chemical properties. 
Physical properties can occur without changing the identity or nature of the matter. 
It is important to know that if the physical properties such as the size and shape of an object changes, the chemical properties does not change. 
However, chemical properties have the capability to change into a different matter containing different properties.
