Matter is what makes up all objects or substances and contains both volume and mass. 
Some types of matter are easily observable with the senses but others are harder to identify without the assistance of a microscope. 
To classify matter one must identify the physical and chemical properties. 
The physical properties are those that can be observed without changing the matter itself.  
Examples of physical property are malleability, boiling point, melting point, solubility, and others. 
The chemical properties involve changing the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. 
Examples of this are rusting and flammability, because it systematically changes the matter itself. 
The primary difference between a physical and chemical change is the changing of the substance into a new matter in a chemical change. 
By changing the physical property of the substance, the matter itself does not change, but in a chemical change the substance itself becomes something new.
All matter has energy, although it cannot be seen or touched. 
The law of conservation of energy is the notion that energy can be transferred between objects but cannot be created or destroyed. 
Mechanical energy is a cause of the object's motion or position; broken down there are two different kinds of mechanical energy. 
Kinetic energy is because of the object's motion and potential energy is because of the object's position.
