Matter
all the objects and substances
space around us
can be detected
because it contains volume and mass
volume and mass
Trees rocks animals dust mites and air
are considered
examples of matter all
examples of matter
to help us identify matter
identify
matter
Physical and chemical properties
the two main types of properties used to classify matter
the two main types
to classify matter
Physical properties
observed without changing the identity of the object
into different shapes and sizes For example
into different shapes and sizes
does not change
the substances in clay
the substances
Chemical properties of matter
by their ability to change into a new substance with different properties
ability to change into a new substance with different properties
paper
into ash and irons ability
a physical and chemical change
in matter
The difference between a physical and chemical change
that a chemical change will create a new substance while all the chemical properties in a physical change will not change
a chemical change
will create
a new substance while all the chemical properties in a physical change will not change
a new substance
all the chemical properties in a physical change
will not change
Another property of matter
energy
Energy
is related
to matter because all matter is made up of energy
all matter
of energy
The rule
This rule
that energy can not be destroyed when it moves from one object or system to another
when it moves from one object or system to another
from one object or system when
from one object or system to another
from one object or system
An additional form of energy
mechanical energy
Mechanical energy
the energy of an object
the energy
an object
from its motion or position
motion or position
in two forms kinetic and potential
Kinetic energy
when an object is moving
is moving
position or shape
what makes up all objects or substances and contains both volume and mass
all objects or substances
both volume and mass
Some types of matter
observable easily
harder to identify without the assistance of a microscope
To classify matter one
must identify
the physical and chemical properties
The physical properties
can be observed
without changing the matter itself
the matter
Examples of physical property
The chemical properties
changing the matter into a new kind of matter
changing the matter with different properties
changing the matter
Examples of this
rusting and flammability because it systematically changes the matter itself
rusting and flammability
the matter itself systematically
the matter itself
The primary difference between a physical and chemical change
the changing of the substance into a new matter in a chemical change
the changing
the substance
By changing the physical property of the substance
something new in a chemical change the substance
something new
All matter
energy although it can not be seen or touched
can not be seen
can not be touched
the notion that energy can be transferred between objects but can not be created or destroyed
can be transferred
between objects
can not be created
a cause of the object 's motion or position
the object
broken down there
two different kinds of mechanical energy
two different kinds
because of the object 's motion and potential energy
motion and potential energy
position
on the topic of matter and its components mainly
on the topic of matter and its components
is identified
as being present everywhere and in all substances
that individuals are able to observe certain forms of matter using their senses while other forms are not so easily observed
able to observe certain forms of matter using their senses while other forms are not so easily observed
their senses while other forms are not so easily observed
other forms
observed easily
that matter can be broken down into physical properties and chemical properties further
that matter can be broken down into physical properties and chemical properties
can be broken down
into physical properties and chemical properties
without changing the identity or nature of the matter
important to know that if the physical properties such as the size and shape of an object changes the chemical properties does not change
the physical properties such as the size and shape of an object
the chemical properties
if the physical properties such as the size and shape of an object changes
chemical properties
the capability to change into a different matter containing different properties However
the capability to change into a different matter containing different properties
a different matter
different properties

the definition of matter and how matter relates to energy In What is Matter
the definition of matter and how matter relates to energy
its properties
to energy how
to energy
anything volume
mass
space
can detect
matter because it does have mass and take up space
Common examples
solids liquids like water and milk and gas like air and smoke
classify
matter based on its physical and chemical properties
physical and chemical properties
A physical property
can observe
without changing the essential atomic identity of the matter something
shape size malleability and density
its shape size malleability and density
all properties For example
all properties
without fundamentally changing the matter For example all properties
For example all properties
a chemical property
the observer to change the essential atomic identity of the matter However
the observer to change the essential atomic identity of the matter
a chemical property of paper
flammability For example
flammability
burns
the paper
is changed
When paper burns
no longer paper
A final property of matter
can not see
can not touch
it Although you can not see or touch energy
is transferred
between matter
matter as the stuff that all objects and substances in the universe are made of
matter that all objects and substances in the universe are made of
all objects and substances in the universe
the ability to be detected and measured as it takes up space defined as volume and contains a certain amount of material defined as mass
space defined as volume
a certain amount of material defined as mass
be defined
as volume
as mass
can observed
an individual
of types of matter Examples
types of matter
rocks trees bicycles and different kinds of animals
Types of matter more challenging to observe
can be found
air although ca n't be seen the author
can be felt
can be classified
by two separate properties physical and chemical
without having to change the make-up or identity of the matter
several different physical properties
Examples of physical properties
The author references
as an object
malleable as it has the ability to take different forms by pressing or pounding on it
the ability to take different forms by pressing or pounding on it
Chemical properties however
describe
matter based on its ability to change into matter with different properties
ability to change into matter with different properties
Examples of chemical properties
flammability and rusting as the object is no longer made of the same matter
flammability and rusting
of the same matter no longer
of the same matter
The difference between physical and chemical change
that physical change only relates to the size and shape of the object
to the size and shape of the object only
to the size and shape of the object
of remains the same the matter
The author

is shaped
into thirds although the new paper size is now one third of the original
the new paper size
paper The author provides an example of a sheet of paper folded into thirds although the new paper size is now one third of the original and is shaped differently still

chemical change
when the chemical properties of the matter have changed and a new substance is produced Unlike physical change
when the chemical properties of the matter have changed and a new substance is produced
the chemical properties of the matter
have changed
is produced
the original type of matter paper
by applying fire to the paper and letting it burn

that energy is related to matter as it is defined as a property of matter In conclusion
that energy is related to matter as it is defined as a property of matter
to matter as it is defined as a property of matter
is defined
as a property of matter
ca n't be seen

a rule associated with forms of energy
a rule
with forms of energy
that energy comes several forms and can not be created or destroyed
several forms
from one object or system only
the energy because
its motion or position the energy
The two kinds of mechanical energy
because it is moving the energy
a parallel between speed\/mass and kinetic energy the greater the speed and mass of an object
Potential energy
energy because
its position or shape energy
